Hello! I'm Advait Deshmukh, a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, with a keen interest in the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing. 

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer in the Innovation Team at Societe Generale Global Solution Center in Bangalore, where I contributed to the development of cutting-edge technological solutions, including a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chat system.I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from BITS Pilani, where I gained a strong foundation in computer science and AI. 

My academic journey has been complemented by research experience at the BAIC Lab, University of Colorado Boulder, where I'm collaborating on a project to enhance vision capabilities in large language models, contributing to the advancement of multimodal AI research.

In addition to my professional and academic pursuits, I am passionate about reading books, playing chess, and painting, which provide me with a creative outlet and a way to unwind. If you're interested in connecting or discussing potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out to me at advait.deshmukh@colorado.edu
