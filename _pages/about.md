Hello! I'm Advait Deshmukh, a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, with a keen interest in the Natural Language Processing, specifically focusing on the limitations of current learning paradigms and working towards interpretability and explainability in LMs. 

I'm currently conducting research at the [BLAST Lab](https://blast-cu.github.io/) at University of Colorado Boulder, where I'm collaborating on a project on fine grained entity typing with [Dr. Maria Pacheco](https://blast-cu.github.io/mlpacheco/), (*October '24 Update: We submitted a short paper to ARR and released a [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17355v1) on arxiv*). I have previously been involved in research at [BAIC Lab](https://baic.center/) led by [Dr. Tom Yeh](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/tom-yeh) where I attempted to enhance vision capabilities in large language models though knowledge distillation, contributing to the advancement of multimodal AI research.

I've been part of the instructional staff for "CSCI 1300: Intro to Computing" at CU since Fall 2023. After my work as a course manager for the class, I am now a TA starting in Fall 2024. Teaching an undergrad class, in C++ neverthless, has been an a learning experience. I am motivated to teach more in upcoming semesters and sharpen my instructional skills.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer in the Innovation Team at Societe Generale Global Solution Center in Bangalore, where I contributed to the development of cutting-edge technological solutions, including a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chat system. I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from BITS Pilani, where I gained a strong foundation in computer science and AI. 

In addition to my professional and academic pursuits, I am passionate about reading books, playing chess, and painting, which provide me with a creative outlet and a way to unwind. If you're interested in connecting or discussing potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out to me at advait.deshmukh@colorado.edu
